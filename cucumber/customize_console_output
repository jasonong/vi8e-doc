By default, we suppress the cucumber's console dump by formatting
it as 'progress'. Meaning that instead of seeing all the scenarios
dumped out on the console, we just see a progress of dots.

If u don't like this, u can update <PROJECT_ROOT>/cucumber.yml to
replace '--format progress' with '--format pretty'. Meaning after
customization, u get something like the following:

> default: -r features/support -r features/step_definitions --format progress

Pls do not commit the changes.

That's all. Enjoy !!
