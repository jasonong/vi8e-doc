Installing Gems
- gem install cucumber -v 0.5.1 & selenium-client -v 1.2.17 (install these first else rake tasks will scream)
- rake gems:install RAILS_ENV=envs (envs: development, test & cucumber)

Migration
- rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=envs (envs: development, test & cucumber)

Bootstrapping
- We're using bootstrapper & factory girl to bootstrap data for development environment
- rake db:bootstrap

Cucumber
- We're using rake tasks to run cucumber tests
- rake cucumber:tags
- tag conventions are as follows
  - @outstanding-alex: features to be implemented by Alex

Development workflow
- We use git fetch & rebase extensively and always work on a local branch that's branched from local master

Code merging
